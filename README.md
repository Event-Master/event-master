# Team-Agreement

## Conflict Plan

- What is the group process to resolve conflict, when it arises? Clearly identify the conflict and address the varying points of view. If unable to come to a compromise, we'll hold a group vote. If it's a tie, bring in an outside party. If anyone is getting to stressed out, take regular breaks from. Use safe words in the event, anyone needs to take a step away to cool down. 

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing? Regular accountability checks and group standups to identify roles and responsibilities. Adequate communication and recognizing the difference between no action and getting stuck. 

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful? Enforce breaks to allow the team to collect their thoughts. If conflict reaches an unacceptable threshold, will seek assistance from TA or Instructor.
